* Menu disappear in Chrome.
  Open/close the menu enough times, and it will never reappear.

  Pressing Escape, M, and clicking do change the menu class (from
  hidden to visible and back), but no menu is visible and the canvas
  is frozen.

  Pressing again Escape or M or clicking outside the menu (invisible)
  area will unfreeze the game.

  Reproducible in Chromium 13.0.752.0 (83651) but not FF 5.0.
  System: Ubuntu Linux 11.04.

  Might be tied to the CSS transition applied when changing the menu
  visibility.  Or changing the visiblity property itself. We hide the
  menu to stop the CSS animation from being processed and eating CPU
  while the menu is only fully transparent.  Maybe we could just stop
  the CSS animation, and only change the menu opacity, if that will
  prevent the menu from disappearing.
