= Gameplay =

* Add other weapons.
   - Machine gun
      Rapid-fire weapon but takes longer to kill ships.
   - Portable black hole
      Gravity affects bullets and ships?
   - EMP/Shield
      Deflect bullets. Has potential but needs refinement.
   - Tracker
      Mercilessly follow a designated target. Needs testing.

* Add items
   - Invisible hull
      Stay invisible while you do not fire or drop any mine.
   - Big head mode
      Easier to shoot at, harder to slip between planets but kills on contact.
   - Paintball mode
      Spray other ships with your colors! Rating 2 and up.
   - Mirror image
      Copy of the ship that mirror the player, but turn in opposite directions.
      Fires phony bullets, disappear when colliding something
      (different explosion visual).
   - Drunk mode
      Convert to offensive bonus.

* Scale with number of players.
   Should scale : bonus drop, map size, planet density?

* Add scores
   Other statistics could be gathered: longest survival, kill chain,
   mines used, etc.

* Tighten ship collision box.

= Interface =

* Add web interface for game creation.
   - Sanitize input (unique game id, out of range values ...)
   - Further style the list of params

= Graphics =

o [alpha-3] Current bonus visual clue.
   Without polluting the UI. À la Mario Kart: floating around ship? Dragging behind the ship?

* Leave some ephemeral traces of fight on planets.
   Ships and bullets splatters their colors. À la paintball.

* Add debugging facilities.
   Display messages dropped...

= Core =

* Freeze games without players

* Expire finished and deserted games 

* Get rid of evil global variables.
   Use closures where relevant, pass arguments when convenient.

* Tune collisions.
   - Immobile objects need not to be reinserted in the grid (planets).
   - Don't check collisions between objects that can't collide gameplay-wise.

* Refactor gravity code.
   - Delegate to server
   - Should only consider nearby planets, and take torus into account.
   
o [alpha-3] Refactor client clode
   What a mess.

o [alpha-3] Rework client drawing.
   Find out why Core2 with puny graphic chipset can handle the client fullscreen
   when beefier hardware can't.

o [alpha-3] Share prefs file with client.

* Send full game update to reconnecting / out of sync clients.
   Client should clean everything and start anew from this update.

* Move static attributes to prototypes.

* Rework collision handling.
