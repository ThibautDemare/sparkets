= Gameplay =

* Add other weapons.
   - Machine gun
      Rapid-fire weapon but takes longer to kill ships.
   - Portable black hole
      Gravity affects bullets and ships?

* Add items
   - Invisible hull
      Stay invisible while you do not fire or drop any mine.
   - Big head mode
      Easier to shoot at, harder to slip between planets but kills on contact.
   - Drunk mode
      Inverse controls, point, laugh.
   - Paintball mode
      Spray other ships with your colors! Rating 2 and up.
   - Negative gravity shield.
      Send bullets flying away.
   - Mirror image.
      Copy of the ship that mirror the player, but turn in opposite directions.
      Fires phony bullets, disappear when colliding something (different explosion visual).

* Scale with number of players.
   Should scale : bonus drop, map size, planet density?

* Add scores ... someday?
   Not sure it is necessary right now. The gratuitous space combat is
   satisfying enough.

= Graphics =

* Enhance ship boost visual feedback.
   Ghost image of ship trailing behind.

* Leave some ephemeral traces of fight on planets.
   Ships and bullets splatters their colors. Ã€ la paintball.

= Cleanup =
      
* Get rid of evil global variables.

* Rework collisions.
   - Do some checks before deciding exact collisions. Server can't handle
     30 meager bonuses before crunching half a CPU.
     Octree, larger bounding boxes, check if the object is interested in the collision or not.

* Enhance bonus object.
   Should be able to elegantly handle all crazy ideas we could have.
   That means total control over the engine, not adding attributes to ship
   for every bonus type. 
   
* Rework client drawing.
   - Replace homebrew transformations by scale(), translate(), rotate.
   - Use save() and restore(). Every object should set its own lineWidth.
   - Find out why Core2 with puny graphic chipset can handle the client fullscreen
     when beefier hardware can't.

* Share prefs file with client.
