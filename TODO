= Gameplay =

* Add other weapons.
   - Machine gun
      Rapid-fire weapon but takes longer to kill ships.
   - Portable black hole
      Gravity affects bullets and ships?

* Add items
   - Invisible hull
      Stay invisible while you do not fire or drop any mine.
   - Big head mode
      Easier to shoot at, harder to slip between planets but kills on contact.
   - Drunk mode
      Inverse controls, point, laugh.
   - Paintball mode
      Spray other ships with your colors! Rating 2 and up.
   - Negative gravity shield.
      Send bullets flying away.
   - Mirror image.
      Copy of the ship that mirror the player, but turn in opposite directions.
      Fires phony bullets, disappear when colliding something (different explosion visual).

* Scale with number of players.
   Should scale : bonus drop, map size, planet density?

* Add scores ... someday?
   Not sure it is necessary right now. The gratuitous space combat is
   satisfying enough.

= Graphics =

* Current bonus visual clue.
   Without polluting the UI. À la Mario Kart: floating around ship?

* Enhance ship boost visual feedback.
   Ghost image of ship trailing behind.

* Leave some ephemeral traces of fight on planets.
   Ships and bullets splatters their colors. À la paintball.

= Cleanup =
      
* Get rid of evil global variables.

* Rework collisions.
   - Do some checks before deciding exact collisions. Server can't handle
     30 meager bonuses before crunching half a CPU.
     Octree, larger bounding boxes, check if the object is interested in the collision or not.
   
* Rework client drawing.
   - Replace homebrew transformations by scale(), translate(), rotate.
   - Use save() and restore(). Every object should set its own lineWidth.
   - Find out why Core2 with puny graphic chipset can handle the client fullscreen
     when beefier hardware can't.

* Share prefs file with client.
