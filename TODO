o [merwan] Display engine fire trail when a ship is moving.
   Or rather, display engine fires in a vector drawing fashion.

* Animate weapon cooldown.
   Fade out the ship fill color when cooling down.

* Add afterburner.
   Instant speed-up to escape pursuers, harder to control. Comes with a
   cool graphic effect of course.
   
* Add other weapons (static bombs, machine gun, etc.).
   - Bombs
      Stationary bombs left behind to disrupt pursuers or setup
      traps. Supply is limited.
   - Machine gun
      Rapid-fire weapon but takes longer to kill ships.

* Get rid of evil global variables.

* Check if object is in view before drawing it on canvas.
   Could save some more cycles.

* Add scores ... someday?
   Not sure it is necessary right now. The gratuitous space combat is
   satisfying enough.
