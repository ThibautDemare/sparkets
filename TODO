o [merwan] Display engine fire trail when a ship is moving.
   Or rather, display engine fires in a vector drawing fashion.

* Animate weapon cooldown.
   Fade out the ship fill color when cooling down.
* Add afterburner.
   Instant speed-up to escape pursuers, harder to control. Comes with a
   cool graphic effect of course.
   
* Add other weapons (static bombs, machine gun, etc.).
   - Bombs
      Stationary bombs left behind to disrupt pursuers or setup
      traps. Supply is limited.
   - Machine gun
      Rapid-fire weapon but takes longer to kill ships.
   - Portable black hole
      Gravity affects bullets and ships?

* Add items
   - Invisible hull
      Stay invisible while you do not fire or drop any mine.
   - Big head mode
      Easier to shoot at, harder to slip between planets.
   - Drunk mode
      Inverse controls, point, laugh.
   - Paintball mode
      Spray other ships with your colors! Rating 2 and up.
      
* Get rid of evil global variables.

* Check if object is in view before drawing it on canvas.
   Could save some more cycles.

* Delete useless objects on client.

* Bonuses are a bit spammy on an idle server right now.
   Could restrict to one bonus at a time.

* Stop bonuses from spawning in planets!
   Frustrating. Ideally, they should spawn far from any player.

* Add scores ... someday?
   Not sure it is necessary right now. The gratuitous space combat is
   satisfying enough.

* Ship explosion radius is affected by bullet speed. 

* Leave some ephemeral traces of fight on planets.
   Ships and bullets splatters their colors. Ã€ la paintball.
